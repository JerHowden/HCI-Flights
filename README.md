## Summary

This website provides a few different key tools to incoming freshman at Texas Tech University.

The first and most robust tool is the *map*.  
The map and its relevant data was made by hand based on our experience as seniors on campus.  
All buildings are clickable and include relevant links to tech's website as well as a photo of what they looks like.
We've also included search functionality by name, code, and tag.  
Here are some examples:  
- Jones -> Jones AT&T Stadium (name)  
- MCOM -> Media & Communication Building (code)  
- Study -> Library, Holden, Student Union, etc. (tag)  

Next up is the *calendar* which includes the 2019-2020 tech academic calendar as well as sports information for games and practice.  
There's also information on clubs and vacations.

The last page includes a list of *resources* we believed to be the most beneficial to incoming freshman.  
This includes information on registering for classes, clubs on campus, and mental health resources.
